## <center> Sherlock
<p> Greetings, Sherlock, how about solving some crimes? Crimes are always committed on the station, from small to large, but one thing remains constant: the detective who investigates them. Solving crimes is very challenging but interesting work. So, be Sherlock, save the station from injustice.

## <center> Getting Started!
<p> Upon receiving a call about an incident, as a detective you are required to go to the crime scene and carefully examine it. Then, if certain items are found that may have belonged to the suspect, you should examine them using NanoTrasen's latest product.

## <center> You are a Detective, not a Security Officer
<p> The detective's job is to investigate the remains of any crime, identify the perpetrator, and then notify <a href="/roles/securityservicedepartment">Security</a> so that they can make the arrest for you. You have limited access to security because you are supposed to be an evidence gatherer, not an <a href="/roles/officer">Officer</a> or a <a href="/roles/warden">Warden</a>.

> You are not Security. You are a Detective. Your revolver is for self-defense only.

    <td style="text-align: center;">Your fingerprint scanner.</td>
  </tr>

To take fingerprints from an item, hover over it and click <kbd>LMB</kbd>, after which you will receive "forensic analysis".

![conclusionofcriminology.png](/roles/sec/conclusionofcriminology.png)

"And here are the fingerprints!" - you might think. Yes, they are, but you still need to find their owner. You should contact the [Head of Personnel](/roles/headofpersonnel) to get a list of the crew and their fingerprints, but this is not possible right now, so you will have to search for the right fingerprints manually. Also, to take fingerprints you will need it!

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="/roles/sec/criminalisticrecord.png" width="64" height="64"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">A criminalistic plate on which a person's fingerprints are left.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Now, after scanning an item, without closing your scanner, you can take the plate with the ALREADY collected fingerprints in your hand, check for a match, simply by clicking the fingerprints on the scanner. It will tell you whether they match or not, and a certain sound will be played.

Don't forget about fibers, they can greatly narrow down the list of suspects, for example: Yellow insulating fibers are only found on [engineers](/roles/engineer), it's worth asking them who they gave their gloves to.

As soon as you have found your suspect in the database, you should immediately report them for violation of a particular article.

## <center>Fibers
All gloves have a different fiber type. Below is a list of gloves and their fibers that the fingerprint scanner can show.

## <center> Watson
As Sherlock, you can take Watson under your wing, or rather a [cadet](/roles/cadet) or an [officer](/roles/officer), who will learn detective work from you and undergo training as an [officer](/roles/officer) (if it is a [cadet](/roles/cadet)). To get an assistant, you need to ask the [Head of Security](/roles/headofsecurity) to assign an officer to assist the detective and wait for a response.
