## <center>What to live by and what to hit with?

The most expedient thing to do would be to ask the Captain for permission to conduct <b>legal</b> boxing matches or training sessions (verbal approval is not always sufficient), after which you must report to Medical and get the necessary medical supplies (depending on the situation). Since you are a Martial Artist, it is clear that you will teach Boxers the art of baby-beating (substituting the station crew), and then award the strongest whippersnapper with a golden belt or brag about your own black belt.

## <center>Work Tips and Features

- Remind boxers of the first and second rules of fight club.
- It's a good idea to have medical supplies on hand, we still need these whippersnappers to beat up other kindergarteners.
- Always have a written agreement for the fight with you, you are a professional after all, and you are definitely not holding underground fights, well... just <b>in case</b>, it's by the book.
- As a special feature, if you become a [traitor](/roles/traitor) as a Boxer, you will have access to lead gloves in your <a href="/guides/uplink">uplink</a>. They do more damage, so you can put down the sprouts three times faster.
