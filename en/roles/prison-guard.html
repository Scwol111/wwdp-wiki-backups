A Prison Guard is a crucial role responsible for managing and guarding the Permabrig, a facility for holding highly dangerous criminals. Your duties include ensuring the safety of both the prisoners and the Permabrig itself, as well as preventing any prisoners from escaping or being exposed to external threats. The Prison Guard wears a unique informal orange uniform.

Don't forget to read the <a href="/spacelaw" title="Space
Law">Space Law</a>, even if you never leave the prison
corridors, you must know the law.<br><br>

Your main duty is to take care of the <a href="/roles/prisoner">Prisoners</a>, ensure that they stay in their cells, and confiscate anything they are not allowed to have. To be even more helpful to the Warden, you can monitor the punishment durations and remind them to release certain prisoners when their sentence ends.<br><br>

If there are no prisoners to take care of, your secondary task will be to guard the prison corridors, similar to the role of a Warden.<br><br>

You report to the <a href="/roles/headofsecurity">Head of Security</a> and the <a href="/roles/warden">Warden</a>. Permabrig prisoners are required to obey you.<br><br>
