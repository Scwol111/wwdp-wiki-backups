<h1><span id="Psionics">Psionics</span></h1>
<p>Psionics are entities that have unlocked psionic abilities through various means. These individuals are considered a potential hazard. The Epistemology department, consisting of the Research Director, Chaplain, Scientists, and Psionic Mantises, is tasked with keeping psionics under control. In case of failure, they have several tools at their disposal to neutralize harmful psionic forces. 
</p><p>All psionic entities share a common telepathic communication channel that can be accessed by giving a psionic impulse of sufficient strength to instantly transfer information (which is facilitated by the Shroud). It is anonymized, so you will never know who you are contacting. It may not even be a member of the crew.

    <div class="content">

**The Shroud** is a dimension enveloping our space. It is what creates the noosphere and is the reason why psionics exist. Its nature is still unclear and is unlikely to ever be fully understood.

**The Noosphere** is the point of contact between the Shroud and our reality. Only an awakened psionic can interact with it directly. All psionic abilities are the result of the interaction of a sentient being with the noosphere, vibrations of a certain frequency and amplitude can create various anomalies.

The degree of instability of the noosphere is determined by the **glimmer** or **radiance**. <b><a href="/guides/glimmer">Glimmer</a></b> is a physical quantity that determines the strength of noospheric fluctuations, glimmer is denoted as "Ψ". A glimmer monitor is built into every PDA of a NanoTrasen employee. If the glimmer gets too high, a **Code White** will be declared.

**Among the features of the Shroud** are its entities and its connection to our world. The Shroud reacts to all the emotions of sentient beings, which means that ca#$%using a l%^&t of p@#$inful em%@#otions can [ERROR]. If the glimmer becomes too high, the Shroud and our reality will locally merge, causing powerful bursts of energy in the noosphere and there is a chance that dangerous creatures from the Shroud may fall out and cause great damage to the station.

    <b>Psionic</b> abilities are mental powers that interact with the <b>noosphere</b>. Humans possess a certain potential within the overarching noosphere and the Shroud, allowing some to find ways to manipulate and interact with it. Upon psionic awakening (unlocking psionic abilities), a burst of <b>glimmer</b> is generated. Noospheric fluctuations (psionic abilities) generate 8Ψ to 12Ψ each time they are used.

</div>
    <p>When you are lucky enough to experience a psionic awakening and tap into the Shroud, a pop-up will appear giving you the option to embrace the psionic power or not. You will not know what you have received until you accept it. Be warned and read the text before you accept, you are technically giving consent to become a target of certain forces. Psionic awakening will also increase <b>glimmer</b> by 1-5 Ψ.</p>
    <p>After unlocking a psionic ability, it will be automatically placed in your action bar. All you need to do to use it is to click on it or press the corresponding hotkey.</p>
    <p>Important note: Most often, you can only possess one psionic ability at a time.</p>

## List of Psionic Abilities

Here is a list of the currently available psionic abilities. The "Weight" column indicates the probability of obtaining them through ordinary means, which will be described in the next section. If the weight is 0, it means that these abilities cannot be obtained through awakening.

<h2>Awakening</h2>

<p>Psionic abilities can be obtained through various means. There are several avenues to acquiring psionic powers. Some roles might start with them, and you might get lucky during glimmer events or by drinking oracle juice. Some roles have a higher chance of unlocking psionic abilities than others.</p>
<p><b>At the start of the shift</b>:
</p>
<p>As soon as you begin a shift, including late joining, you have a base 7% chance of getting a psionic ability. All heads of staff, except for the Quartermaster, have a 32% chance instead, with the Chaplain having a 21% chance. This chance is further increased for late joiners depending on the station's Glimmer level.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, each character is given one free psionics "Reroll" that can be used by consuming certain hallucinogenic drugs. See below for more information on this.
</p>
<p>
Two roles that always start with psionic abilities are the Mystagogue, who starts with "Dispel", and the Psionic Mantis, who starts with "Metapsionic Pulse".
</p>

<p><b>During the shift</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lotus Eater Oil</b>: Sometimes given out by the <a href="/guides/oracle" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Oracle</a>, it has a decent chance to give you powers depending on the glimmer level. You need to drink at least 20 units.</li>
<li><b>Space Drugs</b>: These are a weaker alternative to Lotus Eater Oil. They have a small chance of granting you a psionic power. You need to consume at least 15 units.</li>
<li><b>Noospheric Storm</b>: Grants a maximum of three random people psionic abilities.</li>
<li><b>Glimmer</b>: by itself does not give you psionics, instead it increases your chances of getting psionics by an amount equal to the current glimmer divided by 1000. For example, if the glimmer was at 300 when you took space drugs, your chances of becoming psychic increase by 30%.</li>
<li><b>Artifact Pulse</b>: Some artifacts might grant abilities.</li>
<ul><li>Note that Lotus Eater Oil and space drugs both consuming either of these will use up your reroll attempt. If it does not give you psionics, further consumption of the drugs will not trigger an additional roll until you regain your reroll after a seizure.</li></ul></ul>

<h2>Psionic Isolation</h2>
<p>Insulated clothing and cryostylane will make you immune to the noosphere's fluctuations, stripping you of any psionic abilities. However, you will still be able to see telegnosis projections and psionically invisible entities. 
</p><p>
This is especially useful if you want to avoid being mind-swapped, hit by zaps or simply don't want to acquire any psionic powers whatsoever.

<h2>Changing Abilities</h2>
Since the power you gain from a psi-roll is random, you might end up with an ability that turns out to be useless. While "Dispel" is a nice bonus for Epistemology staff, Security, for example, would probably be more happy with a different power. If you find that you have an unwanted power, you can request its removal from the Psionic Mantis. After that, you can try again to get another ability through any of the usual means.

<h2>Methods of Psionic Removal</h2>
<p>There are many reasons and ways someone might be stripped of their psionic abilities, willing or not. Removing psionic abilities renders a person unable to interact with the Shroud and influence the noosphere.
</p>
<center><p><big><b>Mindbreaker Toxin</b></big><br><img src="/guides/psionics/pill.png" style="width:64px; image-rendering: pixelated" /><br>
Metabolizing 20 or more units of Mindbreaker Toxin will remove psionics from a person. It is mostly used in code white situations to prevent people from generating any more glimmer. It can also be used when carrying out a criminal sentence.
</p><p><br />
<big><b>Soulbreaker Shells</b></big><br><img src="/guides/psionics/shell_50practice.png" style="width:64px; image-rendering: pixelated" ><br>
Soulbreaker rounds sever the connection to the Shroud from sentient beings they hit. They require research and need to be printed from the Security Tech Fabricator.
</p><p><br />
<big><b>Golemnization</b></big><br><img src="/guides/psionics/golem.png" style="width:64px; image-rendering: pixelated" /><br>
While the act of being sacrificed itself doesn't "technically" strip you of your connection to the Shroud, being put into a golem forces you to weaken your connection to the Shroud and cease to affect the noosphere. You do, however, retain the ability to speak on the telepathic channel while being a golem.
</p><p><br />
<big><b>Death</b></big><br /><img src="/guides/psionics/macrobombimplanter.png" style="width:64px; image-rendering: pixelated" /><br>
Unsurprisingly, if you die and receive a new body by way of the cloner or a Metempsychosis Machine, you will lose your psionic abilities.
