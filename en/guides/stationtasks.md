<div class="Item" style="font-size: 17px; margin-top: 5px"><strong>The Goal</strong> is one of the essential parts of interdepartmental interaction and the reason you were sent to this station. You are the Captain, whose task is to do everything to fulfill the goal set by Central Command. But what if no such goal was given?</div>

<li class="adin"><strong>Checking the feasibility</strong><ul><li class="sto1">Your station may not be suitable for the construction of a particular objective. Keep this in mind.</li></ul><li class="adin"><strong>Assessing the resource base</strong><ul><li class="sto1">You should not give a goal that will require an incredible amount of resources and force all departments to wait on Supply.</li></ul></ul>

<li><strong>Engineering Department:</strong> <img src="/guides/stationtask/engineer's_icon.png" alt="engineer's_icon.png" width="16" height="16" />
<ul><li>Must build a shuttle with autonomous power, atmosphere, gyroscope, space for medicines and an emergency surgical compartment, lighting, and also ensure the presence of gravity. 
The shuttle should have enough space for two medical staff, one pilot, and beds for the wounded.</ul>
<li><strong>Science Department:</strong> <img src="/guides/stationtask/roboticist.png" alt="scientist's_icon.png" width="16" height="16" />

<div class="back" style="font-size: 18px"><ul><li>Try to come up with original goals; no one likes building the millionth shuttle...</li>
<li>Use comprehensive wording for the goal so that there are as few unnecessary questions as possible.</li>
<li>Assess the strength of the staff. Five people on the station are unlikely to be able to build a space vault with a large amount of resources.</li></ul></div>
