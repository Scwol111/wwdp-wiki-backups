The **Warden** is a Security officer responsible for the Brig, Permabrig, and overseeing the prisoners. They are essentially the Security Chief's right hand and lead most Brig operations in the Chief's absence. The Warden is also entrusted with guarding its most prized possession - the armory, where Security's best equipment and weaponry are stored.

**Minimum Requirements:** Make sure there is no one in the armory who [shouldn't be there](/roles/assistant). Set a timer for anyone arrested and make sure they don't escape.

Half of your job is keeping an eye on the prisoners, making sure they don’t die or get unfairly sentenced, and that they don’t escape. <br>
The other half of your job is arming security officers with weaponry during dangerous situations. You are not a [Security Officer](/roles/officer) and should not leave the Brig unless it is **absolutely** necessary. Stay in the Brig. <br> <br>

Once again: **STAY IN THE DAMN BRIG!**

And more importantly: **GUARD THE DAMN ARMORY!**

</h2>

If you have no prisoners to watch over, you should be coordinating with [Security officers](/roles/securityservicedepartment) over the security channel.  The radio often has accusations of crimes that can be followed up on. That way, you can ensure all arrest protocols are filled out with information received over the radio, so [officers](/roles/officer) aren’t wondering why someone is wanted. You can also check up on reports of disturbances through the cameras and update the records of anyone involved (this should be done regularly). Your fellow officers will appreciate the help in directing them to where they can be useful. You have the power to make security run like a well-oiled machine. Regularly check up on the status and health of the Sec [officers](/roles/officer) in the Crew Monitoring Console so that you are aware if any have perished and their locations.

<h2>
  <div class="box">
    <span style="margin-left:10px;">Second in Command</span>
  </div>
</h2>

As Warden, you have authority over the Brig and all Security personnel inside the Brig. If something were to happen to the [HoS](/roles/headofsecurity), you are expected to take their place and command the [officers](/roles/officer).

    <span style="margin-left:10px;"><a href="/roles/detective">Detective</a></span>
  </div>
</h3>

Just give the detective free rein and they'll do their job. On the rare occasion they actually catch someone extremely dangerous, they will need help with cell timers and evidence preservation. As almost anyone with Brig access (even lawyers) has access to the evidence locker, more dangerous evidence should be put in a designated locker in the armory.

  </div>
</h3>

Officially, [officers](/roles/officer) and [cadets](/roles/cadet) are under your command. Your roles are coordinately separate, but still intertwined. They catch the perp, you judge, book, and all that. You are like the den mother that keeps the home (brig) fires burning. Keep a good relationship with your boys in blue: stay in communication and make sure they’re doing okay. That way you won’t be chasing a clown around the brig they let out to get back at you.

</h3>

A baby [officer](/roles/officer), sometimes more annoying than clowns. Best to attach them to the detective or pair them up with an [officer](/roles/officer). You’ll want an [officer](/roles/officer) as your buddy, as a [cadet](/roles/cadet) might not know [Space Law](/spacelaw) as well and their prisoner stripping skills might be lacking. Still, remember they're Security just like you, just dumber than an [Officer](/roles/officer) and will one day grow up to be one.

**[Click here for the full Security loadout. Be sure to familiarize yourself with it!](/guides/securityinventory)**

Given the constant threat of prison breaks and riots, a well-prepared Warden is a well-equipped Warden. Your locker contains your personal loadout: a Brig door remote, a stun baton, an officer's belt, and some combat gloves for fire and taser immunity. 

The barricades are great for when someone inevitably breaks down the Brig doors with an [emag](/guides/emag), and the flashbang grenades, while short ranged, are pretty good at stopping ill-equipped attackers or would-be escapees in their tracks. **Make sure you are wearing eye protection before using**.

Make sure nobody gets their hands on your card, and that you are ABSOLUTELY sure who the [Head of Security](/roles/headofsecurity) is (in case someone kills them and takes their identity). Your card is valuable, make sure it doesn’t get into the wrong hands. You also have access to the Brig door control console, with which you can bolt certain doors in your department.

Don’t forget that your loot includes anything you managed to confiscate from the [various](/roles/traitor) [agents](/roles/nuclearoperative) [of](/roles/patientzero) [chaos](/roles/changeling). It is best to keep confiscated weaponry and items away from [officers](/roles/officer) and only allow yourself or the [HoS](/roles/headofsecurity) access to them. The [HoS](/roles/headofsecurity) is more likely to know how to use those things properly, anyway.

    <span style="margin-left:10px;">Don't Just Sit There</span>
  </div>
</h2>

It's okay to sit at your desk, but you should be checking up on all the Brig sections every now and then to ensure nobody is breaking in. It is your job to safeguard the entire Brig from people illegally entering or attempting to escape. A quick sweep every few minutes is all that is needed, being Warden is mostly a peaceful job, just make sure the [Head of Security’s](/roles/headofsecurity) and [Officer’s](/roles/officer) lockers are accounted for. Remember to SUBDUE FIRST. Lethal force should always be a LAST RESORT.

**Don’t forget to check the armory from time to time. While it might seem impenetrable, there are ways people can get in without making a big boom.**

  </div>
</h2>

Going by the [chain of command](/guides/hierarchyofcommand), keep in mind that the [Head of Personnel](/roles/headofpersonnel) is not your boss and not Security staff. If they try to get into the armory without prior approval from the [Head of Security](/roles/headofsecurity) or the [Captain](/roles/captain), arrest them and throw them in a cell. Remember, they might not even be the **real Head of Personnel**[/roles/traitor].

This also applies to anyone freely entering the brig. You wouldn't just give a clown or a mime a shotgun without the [Head of Security’s](/roles/headofsecurity) say-so, would you? A good rule of thumb is that only your direct superior can decide who does and doesn't get issued weaponry. The **[HoS](/roles/headofsecurity) has the first and final say on who may or may not be instated as Security personnel**.

Make sure all [officers](/roles/officer) and the [Captain](/roles/captain) are implanted with a Mind Shield in case some [people](/roles/traitor) decide to stab you in the back.

</h2>

Sometimes things get so bad you need to lock everything down.

Additionally, you may make use of portable barrier emplacements found in the armory to quickly barricade an area. Essentially, they are a more durable version of the wooden barricades. You can lock them down using your ID card.

Once you're in, you're not getting out. There are no timers here – this is for the hardened criminals. Expect to use this rarely, as many a traitor will get the blunt end of a toolbox before this becomes an option. Only you, the [Head of Security](/roles/headofsecurity) or the [Captain](/roles/captain) should be bringing people here, and only for the [most heinous crimes](/spacelaw).

Sometimes, Permabrig can turn into Death Camp if you don’t pay attention. Check on it periodically and make sure no Wizards, Carps, fellow traitors, or meteors are tormenting the prisoners.

</h2>

* Keep a close eye on the back of the armory. It’s not uncommon for people to deconstruct or even bomb the Armory walls from space. If you hear them using their tools before they finish, you can always suit up and get ready to space them! 

* Keep an eye out for any [suspicious people](/roles/clown) lurking around the Brig. Believe it or not, many [officers](/roles/officer) die within moments of leaving the Brig doors. Worse, someone might be prepping a nasty surprise for you.
