You are the one thing standing between the ideals of justice and the <a href="/roles/clown" >batshit insane clowns</a> your company has chosen to further its interests in space. However, just because everyone else is nuts doesn't give you free reign to go mental, beating everyone unconscious and strapping them to the beds. Professionals have standards.
It's important to remember that the job of a Security Officer is to **protect ALL crew**, even if they're breaking into the brig, beating the bartender out of boredom, attacking officers and doing other unlawful things - you are obliged to save their lives. Therefore, **never kill, never beat your prisoners.** You should be above an assistant who attacks officers, do not beat him in response, punish him guided by the <a href="/spacelaw">law</a>.

This page exists to turn you from a salty, entitled red bastard into a useful and productive member of the station crew. A few points to drill into your thick skull right off the bat: 
-   The station is not a democracy. You answer to the <a href="/roles/warden" class="mw-redirect" title="Warden">Warden</a>, who answers to the <a href="/roles/headofsecurity" class="mw-redirect" title="Head of Security">Head of Security</a>, who answers to the <a href="/roles/captain" class="mw-redirect" title="Captain">Captain</a>, who answers directly to <a href="/roles/centralcommand" class="mw-redirect" title="Central Command">Central Command</a>. Learn the <a href="/guides/hierarchyofcommand" class="mw-redirect" title="Chain of Command">Chain of Command</a>. 
- Similarly, <a href="/roles/command" title="Command">Department Heads</a> run their departments. You are expected to assist heads in arresting trespassers on their turf.
- You are effectively space mall cops. NanoTrasen has its own <a href="/spacelaw" title="Space Law">set of regulations</a> which you are expected to uphold. Obey the chain of command and eye everyone with absolute suspicion.
- Your primary job is to keep the crew safe. In this war, you will inevitably lose, but an officer has no purpose - only a path.
- If everything goes to shit, just try your best to keep the station in one piece and you'll be the best officer.
- **[Space Law](/spacelaw) is a set of guidelines, meaning you are not required to follow it to the letter**. You'll be considered the best officer when you understand what crimes cause chaos and deserve punishment (e.g. sabotaging the workplace) and which ones don't.

</h3>

Always recharge your ["**toys**"](/guides/securityinventory) after making an arrest. If you run out of flashes, grab a new one from the security vending machine and throw the old one in the trash. Then, take either your stun baton or your disabler, put it in the charger and wait for the light to turn from green to yellow. 

Having a charged stun baton sometimes makes the difference between life and death.

</h2>

Any good Security Officer always keeps some round boys on them. These are delightful little treats you can get in several ways. You may find a stash in donut boxes across the station, as well as use your [hacking](/guides/hackingguide) skills to extract them from vending machines. If donuts are in very short supply, you can always ask the chef to make you some more.

  </div>
</h2>

You're most needed when chaos reigns supreme. When Joe Schmoe decides to take the law into his own hands, it's usually with lethal and indiscriminate intent. This cannot stand. If you're doing your job, this shouldn't even happen. Though more often than not you'll be dealing with the common [traitor](/roles/traitor), sometimes you might have something more severe on your hands. Be wary of such occasions.

    </span>
  </div>
</h3>

The [traitor](/roles/traitor) is the classic antagonist, with a basic objective. A few Syndicate agents have infiltrated the station disguised as crew members, with the intent of sabotaging the station's operations. It is your job as Security to stop them from fulfilling their nefarious purposes.
Since nothing is known at the beginning of the round, and it will be impossible to identify a traitor until he starts to act, your main task will be to establish patrols and interview the crew about the incidents. Counter-intelligence is your key to finding the traitors.

It will also be extremely helpful to familiarize yourself with the [Syndicate arsenal](/guides/uplink) so that you understand [what you are allowed to arrest for](/guides/smuggling).

    </span>

</h3>

Some days Syndicate forces invade the station directly, with the intent of using a nuclear device to completely obliterate it. Anyone who is not a member of the crew must be brutally and sufficiently riddled with lead and laser fire. Fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the clown and the assistant. Protect Medical, it is the most important area. Make sure that the Captain, or whoever is carrying the disk, is constantly under guard. If the situation completely gets out of control, do everything possible to call a shuttle and deliver the disk to it. Don't trust anyone if you can't see their face.  Unreasonably ask them to remove any masks, and stun them to remove it yourself if they refuse.

</h3>

There are green people walking around the station biting everyone! What a nightmare, it's Zombies!
You need to urgently get a ranged weapon, as fighting in close quarters is like agreeing to join the Green Horde. Head to the brig, get your weapon, and move towards Medical. Move carefully, an infected person can be around every corner. Remember that a person whose face is not visible may sign as NOT a zombie, but be one.

According to all the canons of the genre, Medical is the main target of every zombie horde, since it is there that all the wounded and half-dead people flock to. Take care of its defense, it is very dangerous to lose people at such a time.

  </div>
</h2>

1.  Don't draw your weapon unless you're ready to use it that very second. There are many ways to disarm you in the game; even simple soap thrown at your feet can ruin everything. <br>
2.  Don't carry duffel bags. They slow you down and immediately mark you as an inexperienced officer. Use backpacks or pouches instead.<br>
3. Always wear your sunglasses. Otherwise, any attentive Assistant will flash you blind with a flash printed in robotics, and your flashbangs will do more harm than good.<br>
4. Try to keep your distance from the criminal. Most officers are not robust enough to win a melee fight. That's why the disabler is your way to eliminate the threat.<br>
5. Don't go alone to apprehend a target if they are with a group. Even experienced officers may not be able to cope; it's better to call your colleagues for help. If you do have to go alone - use flashbangs. This is your key to salvation.<br>
6. Against most strong antagonists like Syndicate Operatives and others, certain types of weapons will be ineffective, such as flashbangs, flashes, and some types of lethal weapons. But your stun baton stuns absolutely all humanoids in two hits. Seize the moment and stun the enemy, and then shoot/handcuff them.<br>
7. [Space fauna](/guides/fauna) are not people. Do not use non-lethal weapons against them, they will not even feel them (except for stun batons, which slow down most creatures and are suitable for retreat).<br>

    <span style="margin-left:0px;">Tips</span>
  </div>
</h2>

* Riot gear provides excellent protection from melee attacks at the cost of reduced bullet and laser protection, and also prevents you from falling when pushed into a wall.  Ablative armor is the same, but for lasers. Bulletproof armor, logically, protects against gunfire.
* You can move rechargers by unscrewing them with a screwdriver. 
* You'd be surprised, but you can make an arrest without detaining someone. Try simply asking them to follow you to the brig and you'll be surprised how many people will cooperate with you.
* Armor can save your life, even basic officer armor.
* Examining a bullet casing allows you to roughly determine who fired it and from what. .38 - Detective. .357 - Traitor. .45 - Nuclear Operative.
* When searching, do not forget that contraband can be carried in shoes. Also, favorite storage places are garbage bags and the chaplain's bible.
