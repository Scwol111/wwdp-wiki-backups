<p>Space Bum is a role that represents the social bottom of the station. Any Bum must be over 60 years old. Who knows what they were in the past, but now they lead a miserable existence in the trash block, feeding on scraps and mice.</p>

Well, you have no money and your clothes are rags that look more like torn rags than clothes. However, besides tuberculosis and Hepatitis A, B, and C, you have some things you can choose from in the loadouts:

At the start of your shift, you either emerge from the garbage disposal unit or the designated sleeping area. Come up with a story about how you got to this life. Perhaps, 20 years ago, your house burned down, and now you're left with nothing? Or maybe you were the captain of this station, but you were illegally pushed out? Or maybe you're an undercover resident, keeping an eye on things on the station? Tell everyone about it over a shot of vodka! Show everyone that you're a real old senile schizophrenic.

It's unlikely that anyone would trust a stranger who is homeless, so the most you can do is appeal to their pity. More likely, a homeless traitor would quietly kill people in the tech industry, not to achieve goals, but for their own sustenance...
