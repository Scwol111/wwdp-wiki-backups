## <center>So, you've arrived at the station

<div class="imageBox">
  <div>
		<p>The first thing you should do is familiarize yourself with your meager equipment, which consists of a cadet's PDA and a backpack (satchel or duffel bag), where you'll find emergency supplies and a flash. In general, this is not enough for normal service on the station, so immediately after arrival, you should proceed to the equipment room. Open the Security Officer's locker and take a disabler, helmet, security belt, bulletproof vest, sunglasses, and black gloves. It is not necessary to take the jumpsuit, and you already have the security headset and reinforced shoes. After all these steps, you can start your training with your senior colleagues - <a href="/roles/officer" title="Officer">Security Officer</a>, <a href="/roles/warden" title="Warden">Warden</a>, and <a href="/roles/headofsecurity" title="Head of Security">Head of Security</a>.</p>

<center><h2>What should you be taught?</h2></center>
<p>First and foremost, you should be taught at least a general understanding of <a href="/spacelaw" title="Space Law">Space Law</a> and be informed about the basic codes on the station. Also, your most important goal is to understand that you are not all-powerful and cannot simply punish other people, and everything else is an insignificant detail that can be picked up over time. 
</p>
<center><h2>Formal and Informal Speech</h2></center>
<p>When communicating with your colleagues and civilians during your service, it is highly advisable to use formal speech. Off duty, you are free to use your language as you see fit. However, as practice shows, no one will forbid you from communicating with your colleagues (other <a class="mw-selflink selflink">cadets</a>, <a href="/roles/officer" title="Officer">Security Officers</a>) and civilians using informal speech.
