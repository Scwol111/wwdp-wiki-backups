Revenants are ghosts that have been infused with strange magical energy and partially returned to the mortal world. They are invisible to mortals and only become visible when using their abilities.

## Becoming a Revenant

Some time after the round starts, the Revenant role may appear in a special list for ghosts. To become one, click on the <kbd>Ghost Roles</kbd> button at the bottom, find Revenant there, and join as one.

## Become a Nightmare for the Crew

If you have become a Revenant, congratulations! You can open your abilities "shop" by clicking on the dollar sign on the left panel. There you will see the amount of your "Dark Essence". You spend it by using your abilities. **Your health also depends on it**.

You can gain essence by draining the "soul" out of creatures. After you absorb a "soul," the victim dies. But they can still be revived through cloning. From an ordinary person, you get 10 "Dark Essence". By using your abilities, you become visible and vulnerable to attacks.

It is important to remember that after clicking on your victim, if the target is suitable (unconscious, sleeping, dying, or dead), you will first get a notification about whether they can be drained and how strong their soul is. And only in the second phase will the "Harvesting" itself begin. Note that you only become visible in the second phase, so you can carefully choose your victims!

## Souls
1. **Strong** - the person is healthy.
2. **Average** - injured/stunned.
3. **Below Average** - in critical condition/sleeping.

### Body Values

- **15-20** essence for corpses.
- **35-50** for corpses that still have a soul.
- **45-70** for still-living humanoids without a soul. 
- **75-100** for a still-living humanoid with a soul. 

If the soul is below average, you can take it and receive essence. But it's important to remember that during soul collection, you become **tangible**.

## Dark Magic

Below is a list of all the abilities that a Revenant can use and unlock.

You can only purchase new abilities with the essence you've collected from living and dead creatures. You can check your stolen essence by opening the shop and looking in the upper left corner.

## Fighting the Revenant

So, you're a member of the crew, and you've just witnessed the body of one of your comrades begin to levitate and die from the touch of a horrifying undead being. You've screamed about it over the [Radio](/ru/guides/communication), and now the whole crew knows. Revenants can be anywhere from a minor annoyance to incredibly dangerous, and the more bodies they drain, the stronger they become. However, there are a few things that will help when battling Revenants. 

Revenants are generally difficult to fight, mostly due to being invisible and intangible, able to move through walls and take no damage while in this state, but there are ways around this. Usually the best time to attack is when they are draining someone or giving themselves away. 

While they have a <b class="percent">50%</b> resistance to <b class="type">BRUTE</b> damage, they are quite vulnerable to <b class="type">BURN</b> and <b class="type">HOLY</b> damage, so stock up on lasers and holy water, a Bible, or the anti-psionic blade of a [Psionic Mantis](/ru/roles/mantis), as these can do considerable damage to the spectral figure. Should you have the "[Dispel](/ru/guides/psionics)" ability, that can also be rather helpful against a Revenant.
