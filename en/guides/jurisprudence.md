<span style="margin-left:10px;">BRoCM - Basic Rights of Corporation Members</span>
</div>
</h2><div>
</div><p>It is an analogue of the space constitution, designed to protect any biologically intelligent being, endowing it with basic civil rights. A feature of the BRoCM is its direct prevalence, for example, this code of laws is used both on space stations and in planetary settlements.</p>
<p>Representing the rights of intelligent beings, BRoCM is the main legislative collection, surpassing the collection of space laws in this, since they, basically, represent a collection of administrative and criminal offenses.</p><div>

Employment at the station
</h2>
<p>Any space station assistant has the right to get a job, however, it should be borne in mind that full-fledged contracts for the hiring of employees are made at specialized NanoTrasen stations. While on space station 14, anyone can go through the expedited hiring process.
</p><p>
<sub>
Note: An employee who has undergone an expedited hiring procedure receives only 13.5% of the official salary without taking into account tax deductions.
</sub>
</p>
<p>For employment, the assistant must independently fill out a document on expedited employment or find <a href="/roles/lawyer" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">a lawyer</a>, so that he can help with the paperwork. Please note that for work that does not fall under the category <a href="/roles/servicedepartment" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Service</a>, you need to have the stamp of the head of the department you want to enter, otherwise you will be refused. A document template can be found in the section
<a href="/guides/bureaucracy" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Paperwork</a>.
