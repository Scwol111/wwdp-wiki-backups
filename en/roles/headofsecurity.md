<p>Being the Head of Security, tasked with protecting the entire station and its crew, is not easy. It's VERY hard. But maybe you can lead your humble team to victory against the enemies of NanoTrasen.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements: Try to keep your team alive by working together, communicating, focusing on the bigger fish instead of the little grey leeches. Do your best not to become a shiticriton.</p>

<p>As Head of Security, you are responsible for overseeing the brig, the bridge, and making sure your officers don't screw everything up. You're not directly tasked with catching and arresting people unless it's a pressing matter in one of the numerous locations regular security can't access, so you can typically just sit in your office and let the Securitrons and red-shirts do the work. You have more access to the station than any other security officer, but less than other heads. Try not to become reliant on them.</p>

<center><div class="imageBox">
  <div>
  	<p>Your office is located in the Brig. It contains several types of weaponry, special devices, a charging station, and two security terminals, as well as your personal suit, which is slightly more armored than the others and boasts a unique appearance. The kit also includes your usual office supplies, your unique stamp, a key terminal, and a button for closing the shutters on the windows.</p>
    <p>The contents of your cabinet include an officer's belt, a set of spare clothes, a <a href="/guides/securityinventory" alt="securityinventory" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">disabler</a>, a jetpack, a fashionable cloak, and a door remote. It is recommended to take most of these items, as they might come in handy when you really need them. The cabinet also holds some items, such as the WT-550 automatic rifle, depending on the generosity of Central Command.</p>

<p>As the head of the security department, you are responsible for a large number of employees in your team. It's important to stay on top of things and ensure that they are performing their duties correctly. You oversee the following people:</p>

<td><img src="/roles/warden.png"><br><a href="/roles/warden" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Warden</a></td>
<td>The Brigade's watchdog. Make sure he keeps all the timers on the prisoner containment cameras under control, maintains the Brigade's operation and does not leave it while prisoners are there. He is next in line for your position if you are replaced, and your senior lieutenant. Treat him like your right hand, as in most situations he will be able to manage the Brigade perfectly on his own.</td>

<td><img src="/roles/detective.png"><br><a href="/roles/detective" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Detective</a></td>
<td>Just let him do his thing. He's used to working with a fair amount of autonomy from the rest of the team. Just be sure to check in on him from time to time and be ready to send in some red shirts if he uncovers something serious.</td>
</tr>

<td><img src="/roles/prison-guard.png"><br><a href="/roles/prison-guard" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Prison Guard</a></td>
<td>The warden's right hand, watches the prisoners and the brig. Don't forget to check their work from time to time.</td>

<td><img src="/roles/officer.png"><br><a href="/roles/officer" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Security Officer</a></td>
<td>These are your pawns and your job is to manage them effectively. Upon arrival at the station, brief each officer and assign them tasks. Demand discipline from them, yell at them if necessary. An effective tool can also be to put especially incomprehensible officers in a cell. In a pinch, don't be afraid to fire them and ask the Head of Personnel for new ones. Sometimes a new player may appear in your team, so don't be too hard on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="/roles/cadet.png"><br><a href="/roles/cadet" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Cadet</a></td>
<td>Cadets are the producers in the Brigade's ecological pyramid. Still green like grass. At the start of your shift, assign a cadet to each officer to be trained and supervised, otherwise they'll lure the poor guys into the dorms. If you have any spare cadets, send them to be trained by the <a href="/roles/warden" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Warden</a> or put them in the care of the <a href="/roles/veteran" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Veteran</a>, who will explain the rules of the place and the basics.</td>

<p>Each officer can be assigned by you to a particular department. Department officers are provided with their own small office, from which the vigilant guardian can monitor order in the department. Your task is to ensure that each department is staffed by a security officer. If a department becomes a hotbed of criminal activity, it may be a good idea to reassign more people to that department.</p>

<p>The most standard and well-known mode. Several syndicate agents infiltrate the station, disguised as crew members. Each agent receives a special weapon "store" from their superiors - an <a href="/guides/uplink" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">uplink</a> and specific tasks to complete. Agents are unaware of each other, but they have special secret words that allow them to identify other agents within the crew without revealing their role to everyone around them.</p>
<p>As Head of Security, your task is to strategically distribute Security forces to identify and neutralize as many agents as possible. You may face active resistance if any of the agents feel confident enough to act openly. In such a case, everything will depend on the combat capabilities of the entire Security team.</p>

<p>Red spacesuits, a dead <a href="/roles/captain" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Captain</a>, a blown-up medbay, oh my god! A nuclear emergency is probably one of the most challenging rounds for the Chief Security Officer, requiring a lot of knowledge and the ability to withstand a terrorist strike team aboard the station. The bottom line is: there's a damn disk and you need to protect it. All operatives have their own pinpointers, so remember that hiding the disk is a no-go as they can easily track it. There are also a few such on the station - in the Storage and Captain's cabin.</p>
<p>When the Syndicate declares war, you'll have to urgently arm the entire station crew (yes, even the clown). Order weapon crates and ammunition from Cargo, bulletproof vests with helmets, and start setting up defensive structures all over the station. If you don't trust the Captain or other heads with the disk's safety, take that responsibility yourself, trying to stay away from the battlefield and hoping for brave passengers standing on the barricades.</p>
<p>You still lost the disk? It's not the end, so don't be afraid to put on your spacesuit and chase these bastards right to their own shuttle. Never lose hope.</p>

<ul>
<li> If you mark all the weapons in the arsenal and all the gear you hand out, you'll know exactly who and how messed up when the shotgun ends up in the clown's hands. </li>
<li> If you fill an air tank with 20% O2 and 80% N2O, set the pressure to 101 kPa, put it on someone with a mask, and turn on the mixture supply, you can give them a fate worse than death for almost eternity. </li>
<li> You can replenish your armory by ordering weapons in cargo, so that in case of danger, more people can fight back. </li>
<li> If you take a shotgun, <s>fill it with buckshot,</s> and cut off the barrel with a circular saw, you can put it in a backpack, which will be a great countermeasure against users of energy swords/shields. </li>
<li> Don't forget to track your officers' vital signs by implanting them with the "Tracker" implant. You don't want to get a disguised traitor on your team, do you? </li>
