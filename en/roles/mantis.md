The Psionic Mantis is the psionic investigator of Epistemics. While they report to the Mystagogue, their ability to locate and identify psionics can be very helpful to security if one is causing trouble. Thus, while a Mantis’ key jobs are to identify the psychic powers of the crew and analyze evidence, they can assist many other roles with some authority.

## <center>Tips</center>

- Don’t forget you’re a member of Epistemics. You have the access and ability to progress research or control glimmer in the absence of acolytes.
- Your Metapsionic Pulse is key to identifying nearby psychics and recognizing abilities they use. However, it has an inconveniently large radius, and can be affected by psychic phenomena that aren’t the crew, such as The Oracle.
- Telepathic speech comes through anonymously. While it can help you identify crew members with powers and can be used to communicate even while in critical condition, it can never be fully trusted.
- Psychics aren’t inherently evil. There are many who never use their powers or can be called upon to help in times of need. Don’t underestimate a trusted friend’s ability to gather information with Telegnosis.
- Unless on Code White, psionics are protected just like any other sophont. Only mindbreaker people with express permission of Captain, the Head of Security, or Mystagouge.
