## Mission Types

Here is a list of possible objectives for a Syndicate Agent. They can be quite dangerous and difficult, so for most of them you will need good equipment and an equally good plan of action.

<center style="overflow-x: auto">
  <table class="ant">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Objective</th>
        <th>Difficulty</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="/roles/traitor/black_gloves.png"><br>Steal Especially Valuable Item</td>
        <td>Medium to Hard</td>
        <td>You need to steal one of the <a href="/guides/especiallyvaluableitems">Especially Valuable Items</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="/roles/traitor/sword.gif"><br>Assassination</td>
        <td>Medium to Hard</td>
        <td>You will need to kill one of the crew members and ensure they stay dead until the end of the round.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="/roles/traitor/eshield-on.png"><br>Protection</td>
        <td>Easy to Medium</td>
        <td>You are required to prevent your target from dying.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="/roles/traitor/syndisuit.png"><br>Assist</td>
        <td>Easy to Medium</td>
        <td>Help complete at least half of your target's objectives.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="/roles/traitor/adrenalimp.png"><br>Escape</td>
        <td>Medium</td>
        <td>You must escape the station on a shuttle, alive and uncaptured.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="/roles/traitor/bombimplant.png"><br>Go Out With a Bang</td>
        <td>Easy</td>
        <td>Any death will do; get creative or just slice and dice your way through everyone until you're put down.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="/roles/traitor/emag.png"><br>Hijack the Emergency Shuttle</td>
        <td>Hard</td>
        <td>You need to escape alone on the Emergency Shuttle. To complete this objective, use the <a href="/guides/emag">Emag</a> on the Emergency Shuttle console to start a ten-second countdown before the shuttle departs for Central Command.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

## Uplink

To achieve their objectives, Agents have an Uplink. To open it, you need to:

1. Hold your PDA in your free hand, press <kbd>Z</kbd> / Press <kbd>E</kbd> on it.
2. Open the second tab.
3. Change the ringtone to the code (you can see the code by pressing <kbd>C</kbd>, don't tell it to anyone, not even other Agents!).
4. Two new buttons will appear in the same PDA tab.
5. The "**Open Uplink**" button opens the Syndicate shop.
6. After using the uplink, close it by pressing the "**Close Uplink**" button. You can also keep the Uplink window open in case you need to buy something quickly, but don't forget to lock it if you are being searched. 

  <p style="font-weight: bold; text-shadow: #424242 3px 3px 3px;">Any crew member can see and use an open Uplink, keep that in mind!</p>

Initially, every Traitor has 20 telecrystals (they are needed to buy items). You can find another Traitor and cooperate with them (or kill them). Now you can buy something from the [Syndicate items](/guides/uplink). You can also buy and use an Uplink Implant. In this case, to open it, you will need to use a new action in the left panel to add TCs to it; you need to eat them.

## Imagination

The primary task of a Traitor, as a player, is to make the round more interesting. Kill your targets in interesting ways, for example, by simulating accidents. Frame other people for your benefit! You are the one who sets the pace for the round. Don't be afraid to take risks, because if an Agent spends the entire round thinking about what to do, everyone will get bored and ask for a restart, or some clown will take matters into their own hands. 

## Crew Knowledge About Traitors

<table class="base tb">
<tr><th>Basic Knowledge</th></tr>
<tr><td>Before being hired, you were informed about the presence of enemy activity at NanoTrasen facilities. You are certain that Traitors are qualified and trained personnel, devoid of fear and weakness, pity and conscience.</td></tr>
</table>

<table class="inf tb">
<tr><th>Informed Personnel Knowledge</th></tr>
<tr><td>You have been informed that there are threats on the station and that they use a variety of strategies—from harmless to highly destructive. An ordinary security officer has no idea that this <a href="/guides/uplink#utilities">pen</a> actually injects reagents into a person unless, of course, you've moonlighted as a <a href="/roles/scientist">scientist</a> before. But any station employee can definitely tell the difference between a machine gun and a revolver.<br><br>Usually, a traitor can be identified by items such as cryptographic sequencers, energy swords, and pistols. Employees who are equipped with a "Loyalty" implant have undergone special checks at Central Command and cannot even be suspected of belonging to the Syndicate. These include the entire Security Department and the Captain. You have also been notified about the possible objectives of the traitors.</td></tr>
