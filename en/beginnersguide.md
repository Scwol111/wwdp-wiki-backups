<p>Welcome to Space Station 14! You and your teammates have just started your shift aboard the <a href="https://ss14.su/maps" class="is-external-link">space station</a> <a href="/backstory#nanotrasen" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">NanoTrasen</a>. Each of you has <a href="/roles" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">your own job</a>, and we hope you will enjoy the experience.</p>
<p>Please make sure you understand the <a href="/rules" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Rules</a>, which you can review at any time by pressing Escape and selecting the "Rules" menu item. We also strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the <a href="/guides/interactions" class="is-internal-link is-invalid-page">interaction guide</a> in the game. To facilitate communication in the game, a specific <a href="/guides/terminology" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">slang vocabulary</a> is used.</p>
<p>If you have any questions:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Study the <a href="/guides/interactions" class="is-internal-link is-invalid-page">interactions</a>.</li>
   <li>Refer to the <a href="/roles" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">wiki articles</a> if your question is related to understanding a particular role.</li>
   <li>Consult with your colleagues using the <a href="/guides/communication" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">radio</a> or ask in <a href="https://discord.gg/avwXNAsBgu" class="is-external-link">Discord</a>.</li>
   <li>Ask the <a href="/administration" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">administration</a> by pressing F1 and submitting your question.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are all part of the team, and we all need to work together (even the <a href="/roles/clown" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Clown</a>). You should not harm each other without reason. Before resorting to violence, it’s best to call <a href="/roles/securityservicedepartment" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Security</a> first and try to detain the offender. Do not commit murder unless, of course, you are a <a href="/roles/traitor" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Traitor</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some keys that might be useful to you in the game. The rest, as well as these, can be found in the settings.</p>

<p>But don’t think that’s all! Here are a couple of tips:</p>
<ul>
   <li>If you want to search someone, drag them onto yourself.</li>
   <li>If you want to climb or sit on something, drag yourself onto it or press <code>Alt+LMB</code> on it.</li>
   <li>If you are a <a href="/roles/traitor" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Traitor</a>, press <code>C</code> to see your objectives and the code phrases with ringtone for the PDA.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gameplay" class="toc-header"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#gameplay">¶</a>Gameplay</h2>
<p>SS14 is a <a href="/guides/roleplayingguide" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">role-playing game</a> at its core—you play as a crew member of the station, whom you can customize in the lobby before joining the game. There, you can choose the job your character performs, how they look, how people should treat them, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you spawn, you should act as your character or stay <a href="/guides/terminology" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">"in character" (<strong>IC</strong>)</a>. When in character, you forget all knowledge from previous rounds or the outside world and play as if you are truly a crew member of the station.</p>
<p><a href="/guides/terminology" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">"Out of character" (<strong>OOC</strong>)</a> is the opposite of <a href="/guides/terminology" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">"In character" (<strong>IC</strong>)</a>. This includes any conversations you have outside the game world, such as in the special <strong>OOC</strong> chat, in a private message, or chatting with your friends. You should not discuss the current round or anything <strong>IC</strong> in <strong>OOC</strong> channels. Similarly, anything you see or read in <strong>OOC</strong> <em><strong>must not</strong></em> be used by your character in the game. If one of your friends identifies a traitor or tells you they’re dying in a specific location, <em><strong>you must ignore it</strong></em> and go about your business as if you don’t know. Attempting to help them is considered <a href="/rules" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Metagaming</a> and will lead to a ban.</p>
<p>If you suspect that a player in the game is using meta-knowledge (for example, you are a traitor, and someone kills you before you can do anything to them), you should report them in AHelp or in the <a href="https://discord.gg/avwXNAsBgu" class="is-external-link">project's Discord</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, when you are in the game:</p>
<div class="tbll" style="text-align: center;">
   <table style="border: none; margin: 0 auto;">
      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <th style="border: none; text-align: center;"> <font color="#00e600" size="5">Correct</font> </th>
            <th style="border: none; text-align: center;"> <font color="red" size="5">Incorrect</font> </th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td style="border: none; text-align: left;"> • Stay in character<br> • Act as your character would in the given situation<br> • Ask for help if needed </td>
            <td style="border: none; text-align: left;"> • Discuss the round elsewhere (until it’s over)<br> • Share round information in OOC </td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>
</div>
<h2 id="antagonists" class="toc-header"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#antagonists"></a> Antagonists</h2>
<p>To add some excitement to the game, some players are selected to work against the crew as Antagonists or <strong>antags</strong>. There are various types of antagonists, such as a <a href="/roles/traitor" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Traitor</a> or a <a href="/roles/patientzero" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Zombie</a>. You can opt in to become an antagonist by checking the corresponding box in the <strong>Character Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>Opting in to be an antagonist does not guarantee you will be selected as one. When the round begins, players will be randomly chosen for antagonist roles. If you are selected as an antag, the game will notify you in chat. If you are unsure whether you are a traitor, press C. If there is no task list, you are not an antagonist. If there is, then you are.</p>
<p><a href="/roles/antagonists" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page"><strong>Being an Antagonist</strong></a> <strong>is not about completing quests!</strong> Your goal is to create interesting scenarios for the round. Don’t get too focused on objectives; they are for those lacking imagination! Play as a cannibal, vividly describing the process of eating your victims in the Emote channel. Frame the chef by planting a few of your kills in the kitchen, then announce that the chef is killing people for meat! You have many options—just get creative and break free from stereotypes!</p>
<p>And remember, you should enjoy it! (Ideally, not at the expense of others...)</p>
<h2 id="detecting-antagonists" class="toc-header"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#detecting-antagonists">¶</a> Detecting Antagonists</h2>
<p>If you suspect someone is an antagonist, <strong>report it to</strong> the <a href="/roles/securityservicedepartment" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page"><strong>Security Department</strong></a> <strong>as soon as possible</strong> and try to protect yourself. Remember, under <a href="/spacelaw" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Space Law</a>, antagonists are still humans, so they should be arrested and punished accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>If the game doesn’t tell you that you’re an antagonist, then you’re just a regular crew member, and your only goal is to complete your shift in your assigned role.</strong></p>
