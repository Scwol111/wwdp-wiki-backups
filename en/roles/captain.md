<p>You are the captain, the top of the <a href="/guides/hierarchyofcommand" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">chain of command</a>. Your duty is to ensure the station’s stability and efficiency, and to carry out the orders of <a href="/roles/centralcommand" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Central Command</a>.</p>
<p>You should have experience in all leadership roles. At the start of your shift, **take the Nuclear Authentication Disk with you**, conduct a brief radio communication with your heads of department, and check periodically that everything is running smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Requirements:</strong> Protect this damn disk and your full access. Only use your authority when necessary, the heads of departments are there for a reason.</p>

<img src="/roles/captain/bridge.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<p>The Captain has a spacious cabin, complete with: an identification and communication console, a <a href="/guides/especiallyvaluableitems" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">jetpack</a>, a <a href="/guides/especiallyvaluableitems" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">nuclear authentication disk</a>, the best armored spacesuit on the station and your pride and joy - a <a href="/guides/especiallyvaluableitems" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">prize antique laser pistol</a>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of your shift, take the nuclear authentication disk and put it in your backpack. If you've done that, you've already done half your job. If you're feeling particularly vulnerable, give your pinpointer to the <a href="/roles/headofsecurity" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Head of Security</a>. After that, walk around the station and command people - you are the Captain after all.</p>

<p><strong>Good morning, leaders.</strong><br>If you are reading this, the launch of the station was successful and you have already arrived at your workstation as part of the early group. If not, this document will be waiting for your arrival on the transport shuttle.</p>
<hr>
<p>We congratulate you on the start of your work in our experimental project. The purpose of this station is to study the prospects of long-term functioning of scientific stations as autonomous objects. Therefore, you, as heads, are given a complete carte blanche for the development, refinement and organization of the activities of your departments and compartments of the station.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>We expect from you:</strong> <br> Initiative and elaboration of various approaches to personnel management, technical modification of the station entrusted to you and equipping of departments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Statistical data collected from stations of your type will be transferred to the NanoTreizen analytics department for further study. Experiment and show your leadership qualities, your initiative and creativity are what we need. We are proud of you, and remember: humanity is behind us.</p>
<hr>
<p>P.S: <em>The personnel department is experiencing difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel, so we resorted to emergency measures. In the event of a possible traitor or employee whose knowledge does not correspond to his position, act according to the situation.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>P.P.S: <em>Expect possible additional tasks. If they appear, we will contact you.</em></p>

</h3>
<p>When you are not fighting traitors, the Syndicate, and zombie-virus infected officers, you oversee the work of the crew. You are at the top of the food chain and possess ultimate authority over everyone and everything on your station.</p>
<p>You are the Judge, the Final Word, the Big Guy. You hold an absolute veto on all matters and are the only person who can authorize an execution without a trial. Anyone who challenges your authority can technically be put on trial for mutiny. There is no one definitive way to manage a ship, as many people have different leadership styles. However, as Captain, you must remember certain guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't get involved if there is someone else who can do the job.</strong> Why have a <a href="/roles/headofsecurity" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Head of Security</a> if you are going to personally handle all security matters yourself? If there isn't a Head for a particular department, appoint a new one. It will make your life a lot easier and more interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Delegate authority when possible.</strong> You should never be doing the grunt work yourself. If someone says, "Captain, plasma in the corridors!", you should tell your <a href="/roles/chiefengineer" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Chief Engineer</a> to sort it out. Don't try to fix it yourself, as you will put yourself at unnecessary risk.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the</strong> <a href="/guides/hierarchyofcommand" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page"><strong>chain of command</strong></a><strong>.</strong> You command the Heads. The Heads command their departments. Try not to bypass them in the decision-making process, as they are the ones who <em>should</em> know their departments best.</li>
<li><strong>Be vigilant.</strong> You have a big target on your back. You are likely to be the prime target of traitors simply because of your full access card. Knowing this, you might want to spend a good amount of time relaxing in the safety of the bridge.</li>
<li><em><strong>Keep calm and carry on</strong>.</em> As Captain, be prepared to deal with any or all of the following: incompetent or absent Heads, traitors and angry crew members trying to break down the bridge door to get in, rookie security officers, and sometimes the aftermath of armageddon that has befallen the station thanks to a whole host of the factors listed above. And your job is to manage it all. Good luck.</li>
</ol>

</h3>
<p>With your prestigious title, medals, and luxurious excesses, it's easy to forget that there's an external, <a href="/rules" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">Higher power</a>, keeping a watchful eye on your every move.</p>
<p>Contact with <a href="/roles/centralcommand" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">CC</a> may be rare, but you are expected to follow any orders they issue. CentCom typically issues directives and updates on activity in your sector via the comms console located on the bridge and in your office.</p>
<p>If you're unlucky, you may have to deal with a visit from a <a href="/roles/representativeofcc" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">CC Representative</a> or even a Commandant. Reviewer visits can range from standard certifications, internal investigations, or other forms of corporate interference. Whatever the case, it's important to try to make the CC officer happy throughout their visit. If all else fails, just make sure you can't be blamed for anything going wrong.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that you still have power over all personnel on your station. That is, as long as you remain the lawful captain. If you anger the wrong person, you could find yourself removed from command. However, if the representative themselves is causing problems, you have every right to arrest them, then appeal to THEIR superiors with a complaint.</p>
<p>If you somehow manage to anger both a CC officer and their command, start worrying. Many captains have been magically de-integrated in their own quarters for acting like <a href="/roles/clown" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">clowns</a>.</p>
<p>You can contact the CC yourself using the comms consoles, but if the transmission isn't urgent, it'll likely get stuck in the infamous NanoTrasen bureaucracy for weeks. Even then, it's very unreliable and you could be ignored.</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Ultimately you are responsible for the station.</strong> Captains are often court-martialed or even executed if they decide to abandon their ship, regardless of its state. Since they are ultimately responsible for the station and its crew, their loss can be perceived by your superiors as desertion, mutiny and/or incitement to mutiny.</p>
<p>So keep this in mind when facing disaster. Do not authorize an evacuation without your explicit permission. <strong><em>You must do everything possible to keep the station operational.</em></strong> - so as not to go down with it, one way or another.</p>

</h3>
<p>Your golden card gives you full access to the communication console functionality. This means you can call for <a href="/roles/emergencyresponseteam" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">reinforcements from Central Command</a>, change the security code and alert the entire station. But let's focus on one of the most important - your connection to CC and calling for help. To contact Central Command, you need to send a station announcement, addressing CC. Depending on the situation on the station and the quality of your message, a rapid response team may or may not be sent to the station...</p>
<p>There are two types of teams in total:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling for a CBRN team. If the station has already been overrun by a horde of botanists, cooks, bartenders, janitors, scientists and a multitude of other biologically hazardous creatures for 40 minutes - you can request a special team to eliminate this problem. Weakly armed, but extremely useful in such a period of time, they will be able to take control of the situation and secure the evacuation of survivors.</li>
<li>Calling for a rapid response team. Elite Central Command combat group capable of overcoming any threat. Called in the most neglected cases and has an extremely powerful arsenal. Protected by non-slowing suits and armed with pulse rifles, they will kill you in a few shots if they want to.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also contact CC with any other request through the same notification system. Remember, you are one of two people on the station who are closest to CC.</p>

<p><strong>You are ultimately responsible for the station.</strong> Captains are not infrequently court-martialed, or even executed, if they decide to abandon their ship, regardless of its state. As they bear ultimate responsibility for the station and its crew, their loss can be seen by your superiors as desertion, mutiny, and/or incitement to mutiny.</p>
<center><img src="/roles/captain/light.png" class="png1"><span class="up">"Helpful" tips</span></center>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>As Captain, you should always keep the nuke disc on you: Security Chief shows up with a pinpointer so he can find your inevitable corpse.</li>
<li>Never, EVER put the Disc in your locker. Anyone who might need it can easily get to it with explosives or even a basic tool box.</li>
<li>Don't go crazy and run solo into a fight. You are not a one-man army and nobody on the station has your access level. If you charge into the medbay where a bunch of Syndicate Agents are hanging out and find that the rest of security has no access to get through the entrance doors and help you, this can quickly lead to a catastrophe.</li>
</ul>
