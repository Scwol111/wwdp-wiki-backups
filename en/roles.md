**Welcome to the Role Handbook**, which you can find on [Space Station 14](/) by [NanoTrasen](/backstory#nanotrasen)! 

Don't understand why one person in red arrested you for trying to hack, while another just shot you on the spot?  Or what's the difference between people in white coats?  **This is the place for you!**

If you're new to the station, it's definitely a good idea to start with the [Assistant](/roles/assistant) role. It's pretty simple, since you usually don't have to do much, so you have time to learn the ropes.  Next, you can try roles like: [Service Worker](/roles/serviceworker), [Loader](/roles/loader), [Intern](/roles/intern), [Research Assistant](/roles/researchassistant), [Technical Assistant](/roles/technicalassistant).

<div><div>The <a href="/roles#служба-безопасности">head of order</a> on this station. Either good or dead. There is no other option. You will be praying that if something happens, it is not he who tortures and interrogates you. He goes to sleep and never wakes up.
