@ENG 

Heya guys and gals, sad news.

## Wyrm is closing down.

Slot will be allocated to White Dream GHOUL - mapper-exclusive server. 

There are several reasons for that decision but main one is that I, basically, made wrong judgement about current state of the game and was too rash with my decisions. But, one-by-one.

- At the moment, I cannot offer anything that will be "different" to the players that they cannot find on a Goob or Hullrot. They are doing awesome job and totally deserve their success.

- I thought that niche of "unhubbed underground server that aims to build community" is totally free for grabs and will have no competition - Goob at the time was in a bad state and I heard about Hullrot - but never ever thought about looking into it. Turns out, the niche is claimed - so there's failure in concept of the server.

- I wasn't just "rash" in terms of deciding to open Wyrm - I never ever thought about "how" to build ENG community in the first place as I was too pre-occupied with RU community. Now, there's absolute lack of mental resources of mine to try and think about how to approach ENG community.

**Basically**, I'm going to admit that this experiment was a failure - it's totally on me and we need to cook the game first before offering it to the players.

## Wyrm will be back in the future.

On the RU side of things, a lot of brewing in terms of development - my aim is to provide game that has "spirit" of SS13 but is not SS13 one-to-one clone. Grittier, more technically impressive, proper sci-fi survival horror atmosphere. When it will be ready, WWDP will be ready to try again. 

So yeah, fellas, be mindful of your capabilities - or you will end up with empty server and soiled pants.
