## Other Emergencies

### Evacuation
* All crew are required to cooperate with the evacuation procedure. All hands are to be evacuated regardless of individual status.
* All prisoners are to be transferred to the secure holding area on the escape shuttle unless it would place undue risk on the crew.
* Deceased crew members' bodies are to be returned to Central Command if possible.
* Immediate shuttle launch is authorized only if there is a threat to the integrity of the shuttle or the lives of the personnel on board. To expedite shuttle launch, cards from two heads of staff (excluding the QM) are required. Or an emag, if you're a traitor.
* Borgs are to be delivered to Central Command for further examination.

### Viral Outbreaks
* If a severe virus is detected, the CMO has the right to quarantine infected personnel with the assistance of Security.
* All infected personnel should be isolated in Virology or Medbay.
* Medical staff and crew must wear sterile masks/any masks and gloves.
* Quarantine should remain in effect until the disease is contained and cured.

### Fire and Environmental Hazards

* Immediate evacuation of all untrained personnel to safe compartments.
* Activate the fire alarm to isolate the source of the hazard.
* Atmospheric Technicians and Engineers must handle the situation.
* Pump air into damaged compartments after repairs are completed.
* Ensure that all damage is repaired.

### Meteor Shower

* All personnel must proceed to the central part of the station.
* After the threat to the station has passed, the engineering team must carry out repairs.
* A shuttle must be called if the station is inoperable.

### Supermatter Destabilization

* Immediate identification of the cause of destabilization by engineers.
* Elimination of the cause, followed by restoration.
* In case of reaching the critical point, immediate ejection of the supermatter.
* If ejection is not possible, immediate relocation to the station's maintenance tunnels.
* Subsequent dismissal of the Chief Engineer and calling for an evacuation shuttle with assistance to the affected personnel.
