<h2> <img src="/banner_syndicate.png" alt="sydiebag" class="ppng"> Welcome to the Bounty Hunter Squad <img src="/banner_syndicate.png" alt="sydiebag" class="ppng"> </h2>

<b>Reports to</b>: The Syndicate Conglomerate.
<b>Objectives</b>: Destroy the station using the nuclear warhead.
<b>Equipment</b>: Uplink. As well as a bunch of gear to achieve the objective. 

You are a fighter in the Syndicate's elite unit. One of the best, one of the strongest. And your mission is to destroy the most advanced commercial facility of a corporation hostile to you.

The goal of the entire team is to destroy the station using the nuclear warhead. But you won't be able to activate it just like that, you need to find the nuclear authentication disk, which will most likely be with the Captain or someone from the station's current command staff. Also, there are nuclear authentication codes on the shuttle. With a random chance, they may contain the code for the station's warhead or the shuttle's. You can check by comparing the number on the sheet with the number of the one you have. 

When the round starts, Operatives will find themselves on a Syndicate station, a good distance away from the target. This is where you can find your team, the commander, nuclear bomb codes, and all the equipment needed to infiltrate the station. Be sure to pay attention to who the team leader is. To avoid confusion, all Operatives must listen to and follow the instructions of their commander. This is a strike team, not a bunch of lone wolves, so act accordingly.

You have also been provided with a fine shuttle with plenty of goodies! Cybersun has got you covered!

## Brief Operational Overview 

Try not to linger at your outpost for too long. The more time spent deliberating, the more time the station has to prepare. However, it's important to make sure all Operatives understand the plan and are prepared to act accordingly.

The basic plan is as follows:

-   Order equipment and weapons via the Syndicate communication channel to turn yourselves into a walking arsenal.
-   Discuss a plan of action with the team at the start. Don't rush into buying anything and everything, trust the leader on this one. 
-   Infiltrate the station using Syndicate equipment.
-   Steal the Nuclear Authentication Disk.
-   Activate the nuclear warhead.
-   Evacuate the station amidst a glorious explosion. 

When you begin the operation, act swiftly and try to stick together. If you have the codes for your warhead, and it's been with the team the whole mission, you can activate it. If you have the codes for the station's warhead, the bomb is located in the station's vault.

To find the disk, you will need a tracking device, which is located in your duffel bag: <img src="/roles/nuclearoperative/pinpointer.png" alt="pinponter" class="png2">

Once you arrive at the station, you will see an arrow that will point to the location of the disk. You need to retrieve it and arm the nuclear warhead. The codes for it are on your shuttle, as is the warhead itself. However, sometimes codes are given for the station's warhead. 

<h2> <img src="/syndie_bag.png" alt="sydiebag" class="ppng"> Syndicate Equipment <img src="/syndie_bag.png" alt="sydiebag" class="ppng"></h2>

Every Operative should always have a versatile loadout. Unless it's part of the plan, no one wants to be the guy with 15 C4 charges and no weapon to defend themselves. The more tools at your disposal, the better the chances of completing the objective. A diverse and flexible loadout will allow for more situations to be adapted to on the fly and will increase the chances of mission success.

<img src="/roles/nuclearoperative/pinpointer.png" alt="pinponter" class="itempng"> The single most important piece of equipment is the pinpointer. This handy device will point towards your prime objective - the Nuclear Authentication Disk. As you get closer to the disk, the arrow on the pinpointer will change from red to blue and green. Once the wielder of the pinpointer is within one tile of the disk, the pinpointer will start flashing a black dot. 

<img src="/roles/nuclearoperative/emag.png" alt="pinponter" class="itempng"> Operatives will need a means of infiltrating the station. By default, you will not have access to the station's external and departmental airlocks. Make sure to grab equipment that will allow you to access these areas. The primary form of defense is speed and stealth. If Operatives get caught out in an airlock, they can expect to be gunned down if the crew spots them and converges on your team. 

<img src="/roles/nuclearoperative/war.gif" alt="pinponter" class="itempng"> If you want to bring the heat, use the Declaration of War. Located at the start of the shift in the hands of the Commander. Sends an announcement of your intentions to the whole station. You can write any message, works once. After sending, each operative is awarded an additional 40 TC. It will be possible to fly to the station only after 15 minutes, and also <a href="https://boosty.to/whitedream/">donators</a> will not be able to issue themselves an antagonist.

Remember, an Operative is only useful to their team as long as they are alive. Go down, and the team loses access to equipment. Play smart and stay alive. Keep yourself and more importantly your gear safe at all costs. 

## Strategy and Combat 

There is only 1 type of strategy (so far) - loud. After quickly gearing up, Operatives fly to the station on their shuttle. The main trump card is surprise. The crew is unaware of the war and cannot prepare. Use this to your advantage.

Remember, speed and stealth are your best tools. Move quickly together and don't let the crew call out your exact location. Don't get bogged down in unnecessary firefights with unarmed crew members. It's a waste of time and ammo. You need to keep a close eye on your pinpointer and make haste with the disk. The best-case scenario is to catch the Captain off guard and unprepared. Spend too long stuck behind airlocks or fighting crew, and the Captain will have time to barricade while Security and crew start gearing up with lethal weaponry and converge on your location. Don't fight fair, don't give the crew a moment to call out the location of the group. Move quickly and put bullets in anyone who stands in your way. Do not chase fleeing crew members, prioritize finding the disk.

## Securing the Disk

More often than not, the disk will be on the Captain, in their bag or pockets. Follow the pinpointer until he is located. Once the disk is acquired, the first major objective has been completed. If the shuttle's warhead codes are available, then, assuming it has been with the group the entire mission, you can activate it. If the station's warhead codes are in play, the bomb is located in the station's vault.

## Activating the Device

You have the disk, now to get to the fun part. Insert the disk into the device and input the codes by pressing the E button and turn the device online. Make sure the bomb is secured to the station's floor. The name of the game now is to keep that disk out of their hands. Should a crew member click on the warhead, they will begin the process of disarming it.

1. Insert the disk.
2. Input the code.
3. Turn on the Anchor on the bomb if it wasn't on.
4. Turn on the bomb.
5. Wait for the timer to drop to 30 seconds. 
6. Get the hell off the station.
